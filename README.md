During this challenge I used:
    HTML
    CSS
    Mobile first approach
To change the display from columns to rows I used grid and breakpoints.

My biggest difficult when building this was the buttons that kept breaking in larger screens, that was solved by a simples "white-space: nowrap;" in the CSS class.
